# Django CMS Blog — A Modular, Extensible Content Management Platform

This project is a **mini CMS built with Django**, designed from the ground up to be modular, scalable, and production-ready.  
Although it includes a fully functional **blog system**, the architecture goes far beyond a simple article page: it provides a flexible content structure, admin tools, layout configuration, dynamic menus, theme switching, pagination, and a clean separation between backend logic and frontend presentation.

The core idea behind this project is **building a real CMS experience**, not just “another CRUD.” Everything — from the database models to the admin interface, from the templates to the component-based static files — was structured to mimic how professional, real-world content platforms operate.

This system includes:

- **Dynamic content models**: Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags  
- **Automatic slug generation** and clean URL routing  
- **Full Django Admin customization** with filters, search, pagination, and rich-text editing via Summernote  
- **A global Site Setup configuration**, allowing administrators to toggle interface sections, manage menu links, update metadata, and control the website layout without touching code  
- **A modular frontend architecture**, with reusable partials and isolated CSS for components and pages  
- **A complete blog engine** with pagination, post detail pages, cover handling, excerpts, and metadata  
- **Theme switching (light/dark)** with state persisted via localStorage  
- **Docker support**, ensuring an isolated, reproducible, and portable development environment

This project aims to be clean, extensible, and realistic — a foundation that reflects how real content platforms are designed and maintained.
